# GooseAV
GooseAV is a free antivirus with no purchases whatsoever! Here is the main repo for all the open source code! We have large ambitions, so please stay tuned!
GooseAV is currently developed in Windows Batchfile, however, we do plan to develop it in C based languages in the future.
Feel free to try it out, however it is VERY experemental, and not reccomended for actual virus removal!

Thanks- Leaf
